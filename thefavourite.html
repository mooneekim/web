    <h3> plot </h3>
    <p style="margin-top:10px"> In 1708, Britain is at war with France, and Queen Anne sits on the throne. In frail health, Anne shows little interest in governing, <br> instead preferring eccentric activities such as racing ducks and playing with her 17 rabbits, each of which represents a child she has lost over the years. Her confidante, adviser, and furtive lover Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough, effectively rules the country through her influence on the Queen. Sarah's efforts to control Anne are undermined by Robert Harley, a Tory Member of Parliament who, as a landowner, argues against a doubling of property taxes proposed in order to fund the war. </br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, Abigail Hill, Sarah's impoverished younger cousin, arrives at Court in search of employment. Abigail's standing is tainted by her father, who gambled away his good name and lost his daughter to a German in a card game.</br> Abigail is initially forced to do menial work as a scullery maid in the palace, but, after seeing the Queen's condition, she spies an opportunity to ingratiate herself with Sarah and, eventually, Queen Anne herself: she forages for herbs to heal the Queen's inflamed legs, and though she is initially punished by Sarah for her presumptuous actions, Sarah relents when she realises the remedy does ease the Queen's suffering. In gratitude, Sarah makes Abigail her lady of the bedchamber.
